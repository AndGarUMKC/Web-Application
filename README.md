# Web Application with CRUD Functionality and Database Connection

This project involves the development of a web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and a database connection. The application aims to provide a fully functional interface where users can interact with data in real-time. Additionally, the website is deployed on Azure to make it accessible as a live website.

## Functionality

The web application offers the following CRUD operations:

- **Create**: Users can add new data entries through a user-friendly interface. This could involve filling out a form or providing input through various controls.

- **Read**: The application retrieves data from the connected database and displays it to the user. This allows users to view existing data entries and interact with them.

- **Update**: Users can modify existing data entries through the application's interface. This enables them to update specific fields or attributes of the data.

- **Delete**: The application provides the ability to delete data entries. Users can remove specific records or items from the database using appropriate controls or actions.

## Database Connection

The web application establishes a connection to a database, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval. By connecting to the database, the application can store user inputs, manage data records, and facilitate the CRUD operations mentioned earlier.

## Deployment on Azure

To ensure wider accessibility and availability, the web application was deployed on Azure. Azure is a cloud computing platform that allows hosting and managing applications in the cloud. By deploying the application on Azure, it becomes accessible to users via the internet, providing a live website experience.

The deployment process involved configuring Azure resources, setting up the necessary infrastructure, and deploying the web application files. This ensures that the application can handle incoming user requests, interact with the connected database, and provide real-time functionality to users.


## Usage

To use the web application:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and technologies installed on your development environment.

2. Clone the project repository or download the source code files.

3. Set up the database connection by providing the appropriate credentials and configurations.

4. Build and run the application on your local development server to test its functionality.

5. Once tested, deploy the application on Azure or your preferred cloud platform to make it accessible as a live website.

6. Access the deployed website and interact with the CRUD functionality through the user interface.
